All the separate fleXcroll javascript files (named flexcroll.js) in their
destined folders are *exactly* the same version. All style differences are
made only by CSS, and sometimes the examples involve with changes in HTML.

The exact same javascript files are put in each of the example directories
for you to easily upload a directory and test the script online, and there
is nothing more to it.

If you want to see the uncompressed and human readable version of the script,
please check out the directory named:
fullimage-commented-uncompressed
