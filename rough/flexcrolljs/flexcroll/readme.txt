About fleXcroll example styles:
The HTML, the CSS and the script file is best viewed using a proper text editor.
All .js files are the same, differences are made using CSS, and sometimes HTML.

You can find the non-compressed, readable version of the fleXcroll script inside the folder:
recommended_styles/fullimage-commented-uncompressed
The other examples contain a compressed version of the script for faster loading.


I prefer to use Scintilla text editor for my CSS, HTML, and script codings:
