/* Scroll Bar Master Styling Starts Here */
/* All comments can be freely removed from the css */

/*
Your custom scrollbar images do not need to have the same size as in example images.
You do not need to define images for all elements, you may want to have some transparency,
or simply a filled color without using an image. The example images in this archive is optimized
for the least number of http calls, only 2 images are needed for full operation, but you may have
separate images for each element or make different group combinations in the images, or simply
have a color defined for horizontal scrollbar and horizontal scrollbase, and get away with a single
image for vertical bar if you will only use vertical scrollbars.
*/


/* Basic styling with no images starts here */

/* IMPORTANT:
Note that, even if you are not expecting to use horizontal scrollbars,
you should at least define colors for it, e.g. you never know what font size
your users will force on the page
