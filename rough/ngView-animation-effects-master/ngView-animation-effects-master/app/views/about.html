<h1>What is this project?</h1>

<p>This is a simple demonstration of how easy you can make your <code>ngView</code> directive transition pages with nice animations. All you need to do is set up necessary CSS rules!</p>

<p>Hope this mini-project was useful for you. If you have any question or ideas for new animations, feel free to contact me or submit pull request.</p>
